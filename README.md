Database project for CPSC 304.

Description: 
Our project is to present core information about items in the game “Book of Hours”. This project acts as a centralized place where players can quickly look up data while playing the game. Since the game provides no tutorial to the player and most of the game mechanics are discovered through trial and error, we design this wikipedia for the player to look up the information quickly.
